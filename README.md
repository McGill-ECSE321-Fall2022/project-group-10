# Museum Web Application (group 10)
## Project Scope
The goal of this project is to design a Museum Management System. This system will manage the museum administration (ex: setting opening hours, employees, employee schedules) as well as manage visitors (ex: visitor passes and online browsing).

The team will analyze and translate the clients requirements into a working requirements document. The team will also design, implement and validate the Museum Management System. It will also be made accessible to stakeholders through a web frontend.
